# Use `address` element only for contact information

`address` element is for email address, social network account, street address,
telephone number, or something you can get in touch with.

Bad:

    <address>No rights reserved.</address>

Good:

    <address>Contact: <a href="https://twitter.com/hail2u_">Kyo Nagashima</a></address>
